%%Detecting Extrema
% INPUTS
% DoG Pyramid - size (size(im), numel(levels) - 1) matrix of the DoG pyramid
% DoG Levels  - The levels of the pyramid where the blur at each level is
%               outputs
% PrincipalCurvature - size (size(im), numel(levels) - 1) matrix contains the
%                      curvature ratio R
% th_contrast - remove any point that is a local extremum but does not have a
%               DoG response magnitude above this threshold
% th_r        - remove any edge-like points that have too large a principal
%               curvature ratio
%
% OUTPUTS
% locsDoG - N x 3 matrix where the DoG pyramid achieves a local extrema in both
%           scale and space, and also satisfies the two thresholds.
