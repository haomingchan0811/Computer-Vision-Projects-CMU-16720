%%Compute BRIEF feature
% INPUTS
% im      - a grayscale image with values from 0 to 1
% locsDoG - locsDoG are the keypoint locations returned by the DoG detector
% levels  - Gaussian scale levels that were given in Section1
% compareA and compareB - linear indices into the patchWidth x patchWidth image 
%                         patch and are each nbits x 1 vectors
%
% OUTPUTS
% locs - an m x 3 vector, where the first two columns are the image coordinates 
%		 of keypoints and the third column is the pyramid level of the keypoints
% desc - an m x n bits matrix of stacked BRIEF descriptors. m is the number of 
%        valid descriptors in the image and will vary
