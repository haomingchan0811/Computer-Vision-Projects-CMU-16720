function [bestH] = ransacH(matches, locs1, locs2, nIter, tol)
% INPUTS
% locs1 and locs2 - matrices specifying point locations in each of the images
% matches - matrix specifying matches between these two sets of point locations
% nIter - number of iterations to run RANSAC
% tol - tolerance value for considering a point to be an inlier
%
% OUTPUTS
% bestH - homography model with the most inliers found during RANSAC
